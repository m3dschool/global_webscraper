# Changelog

All notable changes to the Universal Web Scraper & Gemini Enrichment Platform will be documented in this file.

## [0.1.0] - 2024-01-XX

### Fixed
- Replaced react-json-view with react-json-pretty for React 18 compatibility
- Fixed JSON viewer package version compatibility issues
- Fixed missing import statements in core config and scheduler modules
- Resolved Docker build compatibility issues

### Added
- Initial MVP implementation of Universal Web Scraper & Gemini Enrichment Platform
- Config-driven scraping system with no-code site onboarding
- Resilient Playwright-based scraper engine with anti-detection features
- Google Gemini AI integration for data enrichment
- Celery-based job scheduler with cron-like scheduling
- PostgreSQL database with TimescaleDB support for time-series data
- React-based admin console with dark mode
- Comprehensive API with authentication and CRUD operations
- Prometheus metrics and structured logging for observability
- Docker containerization with docker-compose setup
- Database migrations with Alembic
- Proxy rotation and CAPTCHA handling capabilities

### Features Implemented
- **Configurable Target Registry**: UI/API to manage scrape configurations
- **Resilient Scraper Engine**: Playwright with stealth, retries, and error handling
- **Scheduler Service**: Cron-based scheduling with Celery and Redis
- **Result Storage**: PostgreSQL storage for raw HTML, extracted data, and metadata
- **Gemini Adapter**: AI enrichment with cost tracking and rate limiting
- **Admin Console**: React frontend with configuration management and result viewing
- **Observability**: Prometheus metrics, structured logging, and audit trails
- **Authentication**: JWT-based auth with role-based access control

### Technical Stack
- **Backend**: Python 3.12, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Celery, Redis
- **Frontend**: React 18, Material-UI, React Query
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 16 with TimescaleDB
- **Scraping**: Playwright with stealth techniques
- **AI**: Google Gemini API integration
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics, structured JSON logging
- **Deployment**: Docker, docker-compose

### API Endpoints
- Authentication: `/api/auth/token`, `/api/auth/register`
- Configurations: `/api/configs/*` (CRUD operations)
- Jobs: `/api/jobs/trigger`, `/api/jobs/status/*`
- Results: `/api/results/*` (with filtering and pagination)
- Metrics: `/api/metrics/*` (dashboard and performance data)

### Performance Features
- Concurrent scraping with configurable limits
- Exponential backoff retry logic
- Proxy rotation for anti-blocking
- CAPTCHA detection and handling
- Cost-optimized Gemini usage with token estimation

### Security Features
- JWT-based authentication
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Input validation and sanitization
- Environment-based secret management
- Non-root Docker containers

### Monitoring & Observability
- Prometheus metrics for scrape jobs, Gemini costs, and performance
- Structured JSON logging with audit trails
- Dashboard metrics API for admin console
- Health check endpoints

### Known Limitations
- Basic CAPTCHA handling (manual intervention required)
- Simple cron parser (no complex expressions)
- Limited proxy provider integration
- No rate limiting on API endpoints

### Next Steps
- Enhanced CAPTCHA solving integration
- Advanced proxy pool management
- API rate limiting
- Grafana dashboard templates
- Comprehensive test suite
- Performance optimizations
